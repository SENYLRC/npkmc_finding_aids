			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>The Coffin family can trace their line back to Sir Richard Coffin of Devonshire. He
				was born circa 1280. The first Coffin to come to America was Tristram Coffin, born
				January 4th, 1628. He was a direct male descendant and was fourteen generations
				removed from Richard Coffin. Tristram traveled from Devonshire, England to what was
				then New York (now part of Massachusetts) in 1642. Tristram was among a group of 9
				men who bought the island of Nantucket from the Native Americans in 1659 for 30
				pounds and 2 beaver hats. </p>
			<p>Abishai Coffin, a fourth generation descendent from Tristram, moved from the family
				seat in Nantucket and settled in the Hudson Valley as the American Revolution
				loomed. One of Abishai's sons was Robert Coffin who represented Dutchess County in
				the New York State Assembly in 1832 and who is the focus of this collection. Robert
				was born in 1778. He served his county in the capacity of Justice of the Peace and
				was reportedly a very able and amiable man. He married Magdalene Bently, daughter of
				Colonel Tabor Bently and left ten children when he died in 1842 at the age of
				64.</p>
			<p>The Coffin family is currently spread across the whole of the United States. They
				figure in politics as well as many other notable facets of American life. Prominent
				Coffins include Levi Coffin, who was known as the “president” of the Underground
				Railroad, Lucretia Coffin Mott, a moral reform activist, suffragette and teacher of
				Daniel Anthony, father of Susan B. Anthony and Professor James Henry Coffin, who
				made contributions in the fields of astronomy, meteorology and geometry. Dramatist
				“Tennessee” Williams was the grandson of Isabel Coffin, writer O. Henry has ties to
				the family and prolific character actor and namesake of the Coffin progenitor,
				Tristram “Tris” Coffin appeared in countless roles in early television shows from
				Superman and The Lone Ranger to I Love Lucy and The Beverly Hillbillies. The
				Coffins, noted Quakers, were avid abolitionists and equal rights activists. The
				numerous descendents of Tristram Coffin were very successful. In the year 1828
				alone, 26 of them graduated from New England universities, 15 of those from Harvard.
				Though many Coffins still live in Nantucket, a large branch of the family is settled
				in North Carolina and, thanks to Levi Coffin, another branch exists in Indiana. Many
				of the Coffin line also reside on the West Coast.</p>
