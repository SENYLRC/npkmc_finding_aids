      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>In September 1962, the Consolidated Edison Company announced plans to build a pumped
        storage facility, the largest of its kind in the world, at Storm King Mountain near
        Cornwall, New York. The initial application for license to construct the plant was filed
        with the Federal Power Commission in January 1963. On November 8, 1963, a small group of
        concerned citizens met at the home of Carl Carmer and formed the Scenic Hudson Preservation
        Conference to fight the pumped storage project on the grounds that it posed a threat to the
        Cornwall water supply and Hudson River fisheries as well as to scenic and historic Storm
        King Mountain. The case lasted for 17 years. In a negotiated settlement in December 1980,
        Consolidated Edison agreed to drop the plan for the Storm King facility. In the meantime,
        Scenic Hudson emerged at the forefront of the environmental movement. Over the past
        thirty-five years, Scenic Hudson, Inc. has safeguarded over 18,000 acres of irreplaceable
        landscapes, protected productive farmland, reclaimed and transformed neglected industrial
        waterfront sites, and purchased strategic properties to revive community centers.</p>
      <p>Carl Carmer, author of The Hudson River and other historic works, became honorary chairman
        and Leo O. Rothchild was named chairman. Rothchild served until 1968 and was succeeded by
        Alexander Saunders. Initially, the members, working in their own homes or borrowed office
        space, contacted friends, prominent citizens, politicians, and other organizations for
        financial support, letter writing campaigns, and legal intervention.</p>
      <p>The organizations grew rapidly. Contributions were channeled through the Natural Area
        Council until Scenic Hudson was incorporated in 1974. Rod Vandivert became the executive
        director in the mid-1960s. An office was set up in New York City, but the location changed
        several times during Storm King case and there were a number of office managers during that
        period. Professional fundraisers and public relations firms were employed in later
        years.</p>
      <p>Aided by other organizations and individuals, the group conducted an intensive campaign to
        educate the public and to deter Consolidated Edison by legal means. The records, which
        document the organizationâ€™s activities, include publicity materials, copies of legal
        documents submitted by Scenic Hudson and others, and transcripts of hearings before
        Congressional sub-committees and the Federal Power Commission. The case lasted for 17 years.
        In a negotiated settlement in December 1980, Consolidated Edison agreed to drop the plan for
        the Storm King facility.</p>
      <p>The lengthy and controversial case set important precedents in environmental law and is
        generally credited with spawning the modern environmental movement. Scenic Hudson, Inc.
        continues to serve as an environmental watchdog in the Hudson Valley.</p>
