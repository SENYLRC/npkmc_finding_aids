      <abstract>Cameron Stewart Reynolds, at the age of 26, began
      his military career in training at Fort Dix, New Jersey in
      1953 and stationed in Germany through 1956. Reynolds wrote
      dozens of letters from abroad to his parents and sister back
      in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., which are featured in this collection.
      Reynolds’ travels brought him to England, Spain, Switzerland,
      and France at points, as can be seen in the letters and
      photographs. Reynolds was promoted to Corporal and later to
      specialist rankings during his military service, but did not
      re-enlist, completing his duties in Europe in November of
      1956. On February 2nd, 1958, Reynolds married Dianna Wright.
      Cameron Reynolds went on to work for Ring Real Estate in Hyde
      Park and for his father’s business, S.J. Reynolds Inc., a
      Poughkeepsie Chrysler Dealership. This collection contains
      materials created or saved by Cameron Reynolds and family
      throughout Cameron Reynolds’ life, most notably during his
      time stationed overseas in 1950s Germany.</abstract>

    <bioghist>
      <p>Cameron Stewart Reynolds was born on July 21st, 1927 to
      parents Stewart James Reynolds and Marguerite Smith Reynolds
      in Peekskill, New York. Reynolds graduated from Pine Plains
      High School in 1946 and went on to study at Cornell
      University. On May 14, 1949, Reynolds married Roberta
      Shepherd at the First Presbyterian Church in Poughkeepsie,
      New York. Roberta passed on September 11, 1952, but Reynolds
      remained in contact with the Shepherd family, as exemplified
      in his letters. In 1953, at the age of 26, Cameron Reynolds
      began his military career in training at Fort Dix, New
      Jersey. Reynolds was sent to a reception area in Atlanta in
      1954, until his subsequent stationing in Germany through
      1956. Cameron Reynolds served in the U.S. 7th Army- 6th P.S.
      Ordinance in Germany and earned a National Defense Service
      medal, a Good Conduct medal, and an occupation of Germany
      medal during his time. Reynolds wrote dozens of letters from
      abroad to his parents and sister back in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,
      which are featured in this collection. Reynolds had one
      sister, Beverly Emsley (nee Reynolds), who graduated from
      Arlington High School in 1954. Some letters in the collection
      discuss Beverly’s tour of Germany in 1956, where she met up
      with brother Cameron Reynolds along the way. Cameron
      Reynolds’ travels brought him to England, Spain, Switzerland,
      and France at points, as can be seen in the letters and
      photographs. Reynolds was promoted to Corporal and later to
      specialist rankings during his military service, but did not
      re-enlist, completing his duties in Europe in November of
      1956. On February 2nd, 1958, Reynolds married Dianna Wright,
      a classmate of sister Beverly. Cameron Reynolds went on to
      work for Ring Real Estate in Hyde Park and for his father’s
      business, S.J. Reynolds Inc., a Poughkeepsie Chrysler
      Dealership. Reynolds retired in April of 1977. Cameron and
      Dianna Reynolds were survived by son Reverend Dr. Bryon
      Reynolds and daughter Sylvia Reynolds. Wife Dianna Reynolds
      predeceased Cameron Reynolds on August 3rd, 2006. On January
      1st, 2021, Cameron Reynolds passed away at Renaissance
      Rehabilitation Center at 93 ½ years old.</p>

          <p>This series is arranged chronologically and contains
          letters written by serviceman Cameron Reynolds to his
          family back in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. The first letters are
          presumably written as he is in training in the United
          States before his departure to Europe in the spring of
          1954. Reynolds writes of his feelings, conditions, and
          the happenings of Cold War Germany.</p>

          <p>This series is arranged chronologically. It contains a
          baby book created by Cameron Reynolds’ family, somewhat
          detailing his childhood, with photographs, news
          clippings, and correspondence related to the family.

          adulthood are included. Reynolds’ photographs from across
          Europe (specifically in Warwick, Stratford-upon-Avon,

          and with the Tron family in Frankfurt) are in this
          series. Family slides and film strips and souvenirs saved
