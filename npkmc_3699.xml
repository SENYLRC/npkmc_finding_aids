      <p>It was the declaration of war in 1917 that initiated
      Lowell Thomas’s travels across the globe. He would document
      what was happening on the war front and report back to his
      fellow Americans to aid in the war effort. Though after a
      short period of time filming the war efforts, Thomas felt his
      work would be better suited elsewhere and after given the
      opportunity to capture the British war in Arabia, he gladly
      accepted. While on this trip he met General Edmund Allenby
      and T.E. Lawrence. He spent days with Lawrence, photographing
      and filming him - materials that would later be used in one
      of Thomas’s travelogues.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Thomas continued his travels to Burma, India,
      Malaya, Europe and Russia. All the while filming, and
      documenting each journey. Many of these trips were presented
      to the public via travelogue productions and books that
      Thomas wrote. In 1930 Thomas became a radio broadcaster,
      presenting ‘Lowell Thomas and the News’ for 46 years on NBC
      and CBS radio.</p>
      <p>Later, in 1954, Thomas along with a group of investors
      purchased majority control of the Hudson Valley Broadcasting
      Company. In just a few short years the company became known
      as Capital Cities Communications. With the purchase of a
      television station in Albany, New York and several radio
      stations Capital Cities became a national company. During his
      time with Cap Cities, as it came to be known, Thomas produced
      a series of travelogues under the name of ‘High Adventures
      with Lowell Thomas’. Places such as Russia, Nepal, New Guinea
      and Africa were just some of the areas of focus.</p>

      <p>The Lowell Thomas Film Collection consists of video tapes
      and motion picture films arranged by form of material into
      two subseries. The subseries are divided further into sub
      subseries arranged by form of material or subject. Of
      particular interest are the motion picture films related to
      Thomas's Cinerama productions, the "High Adventure with
      Lowell Thomas" series, and the journey to Tibet. Also of
      interest are the films of interviews and lectures given by
      Thomas or Lowell Thomas, Jr. A project to digitize these
      recordings is on-going. Materials without digital versions
      may be digitized at the researcher's expense. Researchers
      should consult with the archivist regarding the available
      digital versions.</p>

            <p>Audio only. Lowell Thomas reports "live" from the
            "Concourse of Sinners" in Marrakesh, Morocco.
            Entertainers performing on the street encourage
            passerby's to "not be stingy with their contributions."
            Lowell Thomas interviews American children who live in
            Morocco. One at a time, he asks them what their fathers
            do for a living. Lowell describes a little Moroccan
            girl at the square who had just reached womanhood at
            13. She picks out a celebratory veil. Lowell Thomas
            narrates the process of men dying fabrics and leather.

            where the elephants are carrying more people and
            luggage through the grass, a man is shown standing on
            an elephant and shooting down a rhino which is then
            measured before being carried off. People gather around

            Zanzibar for salt and cloves, men run in a bull fight
            and sail in their dhows to trade pearls, and men embark
            on their journey to solve the Lasseter mystery in

            Lasseter, Thomas travels to figure out where he went.
            An aboriginal man recalls seeing Lasseter being buried
            in the desert and they journey off into the heart of
            Australia to find his remains. Along the way, the men
            invent different contraptions and methods to deter the
            tormenting flies and Thomas asks about Mountain Devils.

            to track, hunt, throw spears, make boomerangs, and find
            water. At the end of the film, Lasseter's skull is
            found and Thomas suggests a monument be built in his
            honor. ; Format: 35mm; Picture: Black &amp; White;

            <p>In the Congo, Lowell Thomas passes by African ice
            mountains and a volcano, describing the hippos and
            immense trees. He stays in a village where a white man,
            renowned for his crocodile and hippo hunting had
            married a village girl and watched as a crew of them
            hunted a hippo who had been bothering their boats. In
            another village, they visit an English anthropologist
            who was with the Pygmies, and he describes the Pygmy
            boys' initiation and how a group of them made a vine
            bridge to cross a crocodile-infested river to get
            honey. Thomas then travels to Morocco where he
            describes the camel trading business, a man practicing
            primitive psychiatry, oasis maintenance in the desert,
            Moroccan leather, story-telling, prayer, and
            entertainment in the Marakesh square. In the end,
            Thomas heads off into the Himalayas of northern India.;

            <p>LT describes rituals in Madagascar. He says that the
            London missionary failed to change these local custom.
            The traditions surrounding death is that their
            ancestors are not really dead. On certain days, bodies
            are taken out of the grave, dressed in a new shroud and
            fed food. There is singing and dancing, and eventually
            the bodies are put back in the grave. The night before
            a wedding, a Madagascan groom must become blood
            brothers with his bride's male family. This is done in
            a ritualistic cutting and mixing of blood.; Format:

            vicious sand dunes and have no interest in the modern
            technology that the world is advancing towards. He
            describes the barren land, saying that the land was
            fertile and lush during the Ice Age of Europe but now
            only has a few green patches left, with the oasis
            needing to be maintained daily lest the desert take
            that over too. ; Format: 35mm; Picture: N/A - Audio

            all are dressed in white. The rest of the clips are set
            in the city of Timbuktu in Mali. The footage shows LT
            touring the city. There is footage of the cities river
            port, as well as its salt markets. The last couple of
            clips depict what appears to be a staged fight of men
            (bandits and guards) on camels. Both groups are armed,
            but no one uses their weapons, rather, they to wrestle
            each other off the camels. Much of the this footage it
            narrated by LT. ; Format: 35mm; Picture: Color; Audio:

            tanner sings a love song as he works, LT says. The
            footage shows many hides hanging out to dry on the
            sides of buildings. The last couple of clips are of the

            different street performer playing drums, dancing and
            performing magic tricks. One man's magic trick is that

            <p>Another high adventure with Lowell Thomas track.
            Lowell Thomas talked about Alaska being the 49 state
            and that it's vast inside. He said that people are not
            bothered by ice and snow. He also said that Indians
            have once lived there and he also talks about the
            Russian Orthodox Church. He talks about brown bears and
            how they eat salmon but their leftover fish is eaten by
            seagulls. He said that the bear is an carnivorous
            animal. Lowell Thomas also talked about Lowell Thomas
            Jr. and his wife Mary Taylor Tay Thomas flying over
            Africa and other countries. ; Format: 16mm; Picture:

            <p>"High Adventure with Lowell Thomas." (Audio only.)
            Lowell speaks to us from "inside a crevice in the ice."
            He tells is that the 49th state is home to to the
            World's largest carnivorous animal: the brown bear. He
            goes on to explain to us the different customs of an
            Eskimo tribe, and the differences between them and
            other tribes. He talks about different transportation
            opportunities. (How we can get to and from the state
            and how we can get to different locations within the
            state.) Up-to-date farming ensures the best foods will
            get shipped to local supermarkets. He takes us to a
            ragtime-themed restaurant. We listen to the songs they
            play. He is with scientists studying a deep crevice in
            a glacier. The scientists say it is important to study
            icebergs because it is a good indication of what the
            weather will be like in the future. Lowell Thomas
            interviews a helicopter pilot from inside a helicopter.
            The pilot explains that his job is very safe because he
            has a very qualified rescue team.; Format: 16mm;

            few young men pull a vine from one tree to another over
            a river with crocodiles. Young kids play a spearing
            game where an object is swung around a circle of kids
            who try to spear the object as it swings past. Clips of

            cricket and chase a chicken near the beach. The ending

            the children read from tablets. ; Format: 35mm;

            <p>Lowell Thomas narrates his adventure to the North
            Pole with renowned explorers, Donald McMillan, Colonel
            Bolkin, and Sir Hubert Wilkins. They stop at a data
            collection site where Thomas speaks with an Austrian
            scientist about life in the Arctic and the dangers of
            ice breakage. Frog men are sent underwater to place
            explosives on an ice jam to allow Navy supply ships
            through. McMillan toasts the men and comments on the
            differences between travelling to the Arctic on dog
            sleds in 1909 and travelling there on an airplane. When
            they reach true north, the men salute those who died on
            their way to the top. They drop a wreath into the water
            and spread the ashes of Peter Freuchen who started out
            with them but died on the journey. ; Format: 35mm;

            Another man ejects but the wind blows his parachute
            into a crevasse. A rescue plan flies overhead. The man
            sends a signal, capturing the air craft's attention.
            The rescue crew parachutes down. One goes into the
            crevasse to help the man who fell in earlier. The two
            men above radio the aircraft. The air craft lowers a
            basket into the crevasse and lifts up the injured man.

            <p>Lowell Thomas narrates the last leg of his 6 week
            and 4,000 mile journey travelling with African
            merchants in which they bargain for salt in Sheba and
            sail to Zanzibar to sell their pearls from the Persian
            gulf. He briefly describes games that are played
            including Arabian stick ball and bull fighting,
            introduced by the Portuguese. From there Thomas travels
            to Alice Springs in the Australian Outback to find
            Harold Lasseter, a traveler who had disappeared in the
            desert. He describes the Aborigini lifestyle including
            their hunting weapons (the boomerang, used to paralyze
            animals, and spears made from emu thigh bone) and how
            they find water. In the end of the film they discover a
            skeleton where a local man said he had seen his people
            bury Lasseter's body and a doctor confirms Lasseter's
            identity. A monument for Lasseter is placed in Alice
            Springs.; Format: 35mm; Picture: Color; Audio: ; Type:

            <p>Man mines rocks. Men clear branches and twigs so
            vehicles can pass through. They continue driving
            through the wilderness. The expedition crew speculate
            where Lasseter's grave could be. The tribal guides say
            they buried him by a tree with a branding. One of the
            guides walk up the tree and start hacking at it with a
            knife. They don't find the branding. One of the tribal
            guides walk to a specific spot, claiming that's where
            Lasseter was buried. Lowell Thomas follows him and
            calls over the rest of the crew. They begin to dig.
            Lowell Thomas asks a man how they'd be able to tell the
            body truly belongs to Lasseter.; Format: 35mm; Picture:

            with a group of Aboriginal men who were showing him a
            sacred rock where a initiation into manhood ceremony
            was held. The ceremony consisted of story telling and
            other rituals. No women where allowed in the vicinity
            of the rock. The second clip included different shots
            of exoitic animals, including an iguana, koala, and a
            coco bird. LT narrates this footage. the last clip is a
            collection of scenes of safari trucks going through

            <p>LT on an expedition with a group of Aboriginal men
            in the outback. First couple shots are of a traditional
            Original cooking of meat in the sand. Footage also
            includes shots of traditional aboriginal dancing. LT
            and the Aboriginal men (as well as a collection of
            white men) set of in a couple of safari cars. Some get
            stuck, but they manage to get them out. There is
            footage of the men setting up camp. and LT narrates
            this process with music. LT notes that in the outback
            there is a concern for water shortage. They run low on
            water, but a Aboriginal man is able to find under
            ground water by smelling the soil. One Aboriginal man
            leads LT to a sacred site that the Aboriginal believe
            their ancestors came from. In the last couple cuts LT
            and the group of men appear to follow a old treasure
            trail. One older aboriginal man shows them a cave that
            has prehistoric paintings on the walls.; Format: 35mm;

            <p>LT interviewing an anthropologist in the Congo. The
            anthropologist is studying the "leopard society". This
            is a secret society that authorities have tried to
            repress for many years. They are a group of men that
            live in the forest and identity with the leopard. They
            wear leopard skins, and skill people using metal claws.
            They have a stick that they use to make paw prints
            around the body of the victim. They also eat parts of
            the body of the victim. LT is interviewing the
            anthropologist outside a tent. LT then narrates footage
            of a boy being initiated into the leopard society.
            First he is given cuts on his stomach that look like
            leopard scratches. They man who gives him the cuts,
            chews a herb that will prevent the cuts from becoming
            infected. The boy is told to wait, as the men helping
            in the ceremony leave. The ceremony then becomes a
            "ritualistic drama". A man comes out of the brush
            dressed like a leopard. He chases the boy, catches him
            and pretends to kill him. The boy plays dead, until
            another man comes and "revives" him. The man dressed as
            a leopard comes back, and gives his costume to the boy.
            The boy is then given instructions on how to use the
            claws, and the stick that makes paw prints. The
            anthropologist then explains what his understanding of
            purpose of the leopard society. He says that is a way
            of preserving tribal ingraty in the face of death. For
            many African people, the leopard is the symbol of
            death. LT then goes to "the mountains of the moon" him
            and his crew climb them. LT says that they are the
            least explored mountains in the world. There are lakes,
            lush vegetation and mist. despite being on the equator,
            these mountains have glaciers. ; Format: 35mm; Picture:

            <p>The beginning of the film has a short clip where
            Lowell Thomas talks about going to Shangri-La but the
            in the rest of the film, he narrates his adventure in
            the Congo. He speaks about crossing ice-fields and
            volcanoes in the Congo. He meets a renowned crocodile
            and hippo hunter who had married a village girl and
            describes him as he leads villagers in a hunt for a
            hippo who had been terrorizing their boats. Thomas gets
            a short interview with the hunter who tells of the
            dangers of the Hippo. Next, Thomas goes to the Pygmies
            and interviews an English Anthropologist about Pygmy
            society. He narrates as people smoke their pipes and
            listen to a man tell hunting stories. Thomas describes
            boys putting their games to use as they tie a cable
            across a croc-infested river to get honey for the
            village. At the end of the film, Thomas leaves the
            Congo and crosses the Sahara. ; Format: 35mm; Picture:

            <p>Visual without audio. First scenes are of a male
            initiation ceremony. A older man in a headdress paints
            the boys in white paint. The boys are then given
            headdresses made of dried grass that cover their face.
            There is then dancing and drums played. Women watch at
            the edge of the clearing. The boys are then sat down,
            two older men come with knives, and the the boys are
            circumcised, the women cheer. The next section shows a
            group of boys swinging on a rope, one person on LT's
            camera crew tries to swing, but he falls off. A group
            of boys and men head down to the river where they are
            hunting for honey. They see a tree with a hive, but it
            is across the river and there are many crocodiles lying
            around. They find a solution. one man with a rope
            attached to his wrist climbs high up in the tree. the
            robe it then attached to the tree, and is used to swing
            the youngest across the river. The boy then makes a
            thick rope that is attached to trees on both sides of
            the river, and the other men climb across this rope.
            One man then climbs the tree that has the hive. He
            smokes out the bees and throws honey comb down to the
            other men on the ground.; Format: 35mm; Picture: Black

            <p>LT states that he is going to interview for white
            men living in the Congo. LT says that he is by the
            "mountains of the moon" in the Congo. Here lives a man
            who was a captain in the Prussian army during WWI, his
            name is Erik. He was sick of all the wars in the
            Europe, so he moved to Congo to get away from the
            problems of "Civilization". He married the "chef's
            daughter" and become a well known hippo and crocodile
            hunter. Although he enjoys living in the Congo, he has
            sent all his kids to England to get "properly" educated
            LT goes on a hippo hunt with him. They catch one using
            a harpoon. LT cites a fact that the hippo kills more
            people then any other animal in Africa. ; Format: 35mm;

            interviewing an anthropologist. LT asks him what is the
            strangest thing he is working on, and the
            anthropologist talks about the "leopard society". This
            is a group of men that live in the forest and that
            fully identity with the leopard. They dress in leopard
            skin, have metal claws to slay their victims. They eat
            their victims, leaving some of the body behind with a
            claw marking, as well as leopard tracks around the
            body. The government has been trying to crack down on
            the leopard society.; Format: 35mm; Picture: N/A -

            <p>Lowell Thomas interviews a man who tells him about
            cannibals in Africa who hunt people while wearing
            leopard skin. We watch a young boy's initiation into
            the "leopard society." They cut his abdomen to resemble
            leopard spots. A man dressed as a leopard chases him
            down. The boy's friend follows them and scares away the
            leopard man. The boy has been "killed" by the leopard
            man. The boy can now officially be a leopard-man.;

            doctor that's going talk and he explained what a
            telemeter record is. The doctor talked about eclipse,
            radiation from the sun, x-ray channels, x-ray
            experiments , eclipse firing, aspect channels, test
            firing, rockets, iron chamber, short wave energy, and
            where in the sun everything happens. The doctor said
            that they had questions that they'll need to answer and
            one of the question he asked was, "are the x-rays from
            the visible corona or are they from a large measure of
            the chromosphere?" You also hear Lowell Thomas asked,
            "captain where are we and where we going?" The captain
            replied and said, "I'll answer the second question, we
            better go over to the chart table and I'll answer it
            there."; Format: 16mm; Picture: N/A - Audio track only;

            experiments. He states that he will be firing off

            will be able to catch colors that the human eye cannot
            see. Lowell Thomas asks this man questions after

            about the "coralitol." He said that they had found

            <p>Pukapuka: Lowell Thomas introduces the scientists
            and naval officers aboard the ship as they put on a
            goofy initiation, giving men crew cuts while dressed up
            in big hats and robes. Upon coming to the island, one
            of their ships gets flipped on the reef and divers are
            sent in to detonate an area of reef to form a canal. On
            the island, a professor teaches about a specific coral,
            and Natives dance, sing in a choir, play cricket, and
            chase chickens. One of the scientists explains the
            purpose of the rockets and that night through the

            beach, to join him in Pukapuka. He narrates a Pukapuka
            native, Johnny Frisbee, in Waikiki before they head
            off. Dressed as Neptune's court, the men initiate
            people into their service. The rocket process is
            explained and divers are sent to blow up the reef and
            make a channel for their ships. A Harvard professor
            explains a type of reef to some students. Native people
            dance, sing, play cricket, chase chickens, and serve
            the crew. A man explains the rockets to the Natives and
            the process of the rocket launch is shown. At the end
            of the film, Lowell Thomas recaps the adventure. ;

            <p>Footage of LT on a scientific expiation in the south
            pacific . Lt narrates the scenes as well. Its is a U.S.
            navy research team that is going to launch rockets into
            space with data collecting instruments to measure and
            take pictures of the sun. The rockets are going to be
            launched from a ship during a solar eclipse. The day
            before the launch the rockets are readied, as well as
            the data collecting devices on the ship that will
            receive transmissions from the rockets. On the nearby
            Pukapuka island, there is a welcome feast for the
            scientist. Local girls fan the sails as they sit and
            each crabs, and drink from coconuts. The village leader
            gives a speech of welcome, saying that he is interested
            in seeing the results of this mission. The scientist
            give a speech explaining what they are about to do, and
            the high commissioner from New Zealand gives a speech
            as well. In the night before the launch, there is one
            last radio dispatch to the scientist that did not make
            it on the trip. The day of the launch the skies are
            cloudy. This is bad news for the scientist that remain
            on Pukapuka as they need clear skies to conduct their
            experiment. As the solar eclipse start to happen, each
            rocket is shot off individually. All goes well, except
            for the last two that fail to go off. The next day one
            of the remaining rockets is shot off to record giant
            soar flairs. The rockets travel at a right of a mile
            and half per second. ; Format: 35mm; Picture: Color;

            with grass skirts. LT introduces the navy ship that is
            moored off of Pukapuka. LT goes over what will be in
            this segment. LT shows how remote Pukapuka is on a
            globe. He says that he is going there, with a team of
            scientist to study the eclipse. Along the way, he also
            wants to learn about the Polynesians. He first
            interviews a women from Pukapuka that lives in Hawaii.
            Her name is "whiskey Johnny Frisbee" , she has an
            American dad and a Polynesian mom. She left Pukapuka
            when she was ten. She says that Pukapuka is incredibly
            isolated, there is barely any contact with the outside
            world. She also tells LT how the Islands were formed
            from volcanoes. LT the introduces the ship that carries
            the rockets that will be shot up the measure the
            eclipse. He says it is a very modern ship. The rockets
            will go up 150 miles, and the ship also has helicopter
            that can navigate over the reefs at danger Island where
            the ship cant sail. LT says the sailors want to meet
            the Polynesian girls. LT then interview the captain of
            the rocket expedition. There is a birds eye shot of the
            ship. The scientist on board the ship, joined by the
            sailors then do a skit about king Neptune. They play
            pranks on the newer scientist. LT then goes to Pukapuka
            on a helicopter. from the helicopter LT shows there is
            a ship wreck from a ship that got the close the the
            reefs. When LT arrives, there is a choir of children
            singing him a welcome song. LT then talks about the
            "frog men" divers from the navy that are planning to
            blow up part of the reef to make Pukapuka more
            accessible. ; Format: 35mm; Picture: Color; Audio:

            <p>Lowell Thomas narrates his adventure to Pukapuka. He
            interviews a girl from Pukapuka who had been dancing in
            Waikiki. She explains the dangerous reef that gave the
            island its nickname, Danger Island. Thomas introduces
            the ship and film crew that will be going with him.
            Solar scientists explain their rocket astronomy and the
            names of their rockets. As they come up to the island,
            they blow up Pukapuka's reef to make a channel for them
            to pull their ships up to shore. The captain then
            explains their mission to the islanders. On the day of
            the eclipse, Thomas narrates the launching of their
            rockets. As they leave, the islanders celebrate by
            playing cricket and having the children sing for the

            Blurring of the pattern around the margin means the

            four go off as planned, the last two have issues, but
            eventually they are fine. The last rocket is fired the
            next day, and is able to record sun flairs. ; Format:

            where following them because they were on elephants. He
            said elephants are entertainment to the children and
            sometimes the elephants follow them also. He talks
            about how the villagers in India honored them by having
            a traditional dance and the throwing of rice. He also
            talks about Brahma and Hind religious rituals. He also
            said how elephants are becoming useless for having
            because they are expensive to buy food for and there
            are now modern cars. Other people started to talk about
            how many tigers they have killed. ; Format: 16mm;

            <p>Lowell Thomas narrates the capture of both a wild
            elephant and a Bengal tiger. Riding a specific kind of
            elephant, he and the villagers are able to get up close
            to wild herds, where a wild elephant is captured and
            trained to carry men. The training takes a mere 15
            days. The villagers plan out their capture of the tiger
            that has already taken 34 people, praying to their gods
            for success. He narrates like a sports broadcaster as
            they surround the tiger's territory and herd him into a

            <p>Audio of LT in India. He starts by giving some
            information about the elephants. mother elephants are
            pregnant for 22 months and nurse their young for 22
            years. Elephants are only full grown after 18 years,
            and they are the most intelligent animals after the
            chimpanzee. LT says that they going to a hunting camp
            at the foot of the Himalayas. When they arrive they
            unpack and wash away the dust from traveling. They then
            go speak to a captain who is trying to catch a tiger

            India. He says that although its slow, they get to see
            more of India. They pass through villages, and groups
            of curious children follow them. They set up camp, and
            the elephants eat leaves on of the trees surrounding
            the camp. There is storytelling around the camp fire.
            They go the a market place, and LT describes all the
            different performers and merchants that are there. ;

            <p>Students walk in a line over a dirt hill. They make
            their way to the entrance of a small village. Lowell
            Thomas stands with three men and addresses the camera.
            Toddlers wander around while adults herd the strays
            back to the group. We see women sitting around and
            making yarn. Men and women of the village perform a
            dance. Men use goats to help them plow the dirt. The
            children walk to school. We see them sitting in their
            classroom listening to their teacher. The village
            gathers for a celebration of singing and playing drums.
            Monks are seen on a hilltop. The monks sit together
            playing instruments and writing on parchment. They come
            out of a building wearing costumes. Cut to men filling
            up syringes with liquid supplements. A man approaches a
            sleeping/dead elephant in the tall Savannah grass. We
            see shots of several village people wearing different
            traditional outfits and makeup. Lowell Thomas addressed
            the camera once more. A man plays the violin and
            sings.; Format: 16mm; Picture: Color; Audio: ;

            <p>Lowell Thomas announces his journey to Shang-ri La
            in Nepal. He gives a short background on the country
            and its wonders as well as the events that his journey
            will consist of; the royal wedding of the crown prince,
            the Hindu festival celebrating Shiva's birthday, and a
            journey into the wild in search of a one-horned rhino.
            Before the royal wedding he describes the culture of
            the people and during the wedding he gives a live
            description of what is taking place. Thomas explains
            the Hindu festival before hand and the film ends as
            he's headed towards it. ; Format: 16mm; Picture: N/A -

            a place called Tamboo and that it's a sacred ground
            where no women have ever walked, neither an outsider.
            He said that they are there to learn more purification
            rights for men to enter man hood. He said women are
            dangerous and men should be purified from having
            anything to do with women. You can also hear background
            noise and you hear people talking in a different
            language.You also hear an instrument being played. ;

            <p>On the audio track you can hear a man talking about
            Papua, in Eastern New Guinea. He said that it used to
            be controlled by the British and then it was controlled
            by Australia. The north of New Guinea used to be
            controlled by Germany. He said that they were in the
            eastern district, the sub district headquarter of the
            nomad. He mentioned that no one knows were the name
            nomad derived from. He also mentioned a group of young
            men and that they have a tough assignment. He said that
            they were on the land of cannibalism and that they are
            going on an expedition in the east. He talked about a
            group of people that caused terror, talked about
            cannibalism and that the people like to taste human
            flesh and that cannibalism is not a ritual but it's
            apart of their custom. ; Format: 16mm; Picture: Color;

            <p>Lowell Thomas is flying over the mountains of New
            Guinea as he gives a brief description of their mission
            there. He says that the people of New Guinea have
            remained untouched by the modern world and that it is
            their goal to find the Stone Age Man, or the last
            people in New Guinea's uncharted territory who have
            remained untouched. He says that the location they are
            going to is closest to the Nomad river outpost. He
            repeats this description 3 times.; Format: 16mm;

            this jungle the nomad find a group of people that have
            never been contacted with." He mentioned that there is
            one opening and one possible means of escape and it's
            the river. He mentioned that people there knows how to
            make their own weapons for the chance of survival. He
            said boys that play outside of the fortress that is
            constructed by heavy timbers from the jungle. He
            mentioned a long house that was deserted and that the
            habitats were warned and they fled into the jungle
            before the expedition had arrived. He mentioned that
            food was running dangerously low and can't be sustained
            for the work ahead and there was only food left for one
            more day. He mentioned that they walked for a month and
            they walked 100 miles a day and they must find the
            people they are looking for or they would have to
            cancel the expedition. Instead of cancelling the
            expedition they took a chance and they came up on
            another trail that led them into circles. The man talks
            about two civilization seeing each other for the first
            time, he talked about cannibals. He mentioned that
            there was inspection of weapons going on and that there
            is a word called "hesue" that has not been recorded
            anywhere. He mentioned a pig that was bought and it can
            be used to feed the men or it can show the men the
            power of a rifle. ; Format: 16mm; Picture: Color;

            Guinea and they were up about 7000ft in the Igna
            counrty. He said it was one of the largest country and
            it inhabits between 2 million and 3 million people. He
            said that Igna people are broken up into tribes and for
            thousands of years they had war with each other. He
            mentioned about them speaking pigeon English and that
            it is referred to as sing sing. He also mentioned
            different ceremonies that takes place in New Guinea and
            one of the ceremony they were having was the
            celebration of the building of a bridge and that the
            bridge signifies peace and that it takes the people
            into the present and it takes the expedition into the
            past. He also mentioned that there was another ceremony
            taking place and it was for young men that would
            transition to man hood. He had an interview with a man
            name Mick and he was from Australia. He talks about a
            mock battle and talks about how the people are not
            longer at war, h also talks about traditions that are
            still present and the dangers around the nomad patrol
            post and that's where the expedition is working. He
            said danger of the past still present in New Guinea.
            Igna believes that women are dangerous and that men
            should be purified of anything that women have touched
            including food and clothes and that the men shouldn't
            have any type of contact with them because the if they
            do their purification won't be successful. ; Format:

            <p>LT's trip in New Guinea. Opens with LT describing
            the expedition. LT and his crew will be traveling into
            the the interior of New Guinea to where the Australians
            have not been able to "control" apparently it is
            dangerous there, and few people travel there. They will
            be traveling in a river boat. They are given New
            Guinean police for protection. These police know the
            river well, so can also help navigating. A white
            official gives the crew a speech, warning of the
            dangers that lie ahead. He also gives them advice of
            things that they should not do around the local people.
            They load up the River boat with 5 weeks worth of
            supplies. LT's crew is mostly Australian. They first
            head up the Sepik river. eventually the river narrows,
            and they have to navigate carefully. A crocodile hunter
            joins them to serve as a guide. They stop at village to
            trade for fresh fruit. The local people show how they
            hunt for crocodile without guns. The Crocs are then
            kept alive, tied to the side of the house until it is
            meal time. In this village women are skilled at weaving
            baskets that are used for almost everything. ; Format:

            Thomas describes the journey that he and his crew will
            embark on in the uncontrolled territory of New Guinea,
            stressing the barbarity of the savage, cannibalistic
            Stone Age men. Guides are picked out by an Australian
            head of office who describes the terrain to Thomas and
            warns of the cannibalistic country he is going to enter
            and how he is to conduct himself while there. Lowell
            Thomas interviews one of the guides who leads them down
            a river in his native tongue. Thomas also names the
            members of his crew including the Australian WWII vets
            who accompany them. ; Format: 35mm; Picture: N/A -

            wooden boat on what appears to open water of a ocean.
            There are 3-4 men in the water by the boat. Each of
            these men are attached to rope that is being held by
            other men who are on the boat. The men in the water
            have their noses' being pinched together by a peg-like
            contraption. The men in the water then dive under the
            surface. The camera man follows along, and show what is
            happening underneath the surface. The men swim to floor
            of the ocean, and collect oyster in baskets attached to
            their side. The footage then show the men on the boat
            pull the rope, and the men are pulled to the surface
            and on to the boat with the baskets. The oysters are
            then shucked and pearls are extracted and given to a
            man dressed in white who collects them in a piece of
            fabric ; The second cut shows a group of men on camels.
            some men carry spears, while the others carry guns.

            <p>After opening scenes of Lowell Thomas speaking to
            women in St. Petersburg, the crew travels south of
            Moscow where they immerse themselves in a more Islamic
            society. They capture a royal parade and wedding
            procession. People perform in costumes in the streets
            as dancers and acrobats. Thomas is then shown rhino
            hunting while riding elephants and the rhino's horn is
            cut off. In the ending adventure, Thomas lands in a
            helicopter on the island of Pukapuka and invites
            viewers to join him. In a separate scene in front of a
            globe, he locates the "Danger Island" in Polynesia and
            describes the coming eclipse. In Waikiki, HI, Thomas
            speaks to a Polynesian dancer about the Pukapuka and
            how people will react to the big boats and planes they
            will be taking to get there. ; Format: 35mm; Picture:

            <p>Footage from LT's trip on a Dhow around the Arabian
            peninsula to Zanzibar. LT introduces the film sitting
            on day dressed in white ropes and an Arab headdress. He
            is sitting between to the the ships leaders, they are
            from Oman. LT is smoking a hookah, and explains that he
            is journey a merchant ship sailing for Zanzibar along
            an ancient trading route. He says that this is the
            first time this trip has been filmed. They will be
            buying pearls to sell in Zanzibar, stopping at several
            ports along the way. The sailors are woken up in the
            morning by a person yelling to get up. They wash before
            prayer after the call to prayer in Arabic is heard.
            They meet a pearl diving fleet. They divers do not use
            modern diving equipment. All they have are wights, a
            rope to pull them up and wooden pegs on their nose.
            They dive up to 70ft and stay done for more then two
            minuets before being pulled up. They have baskets where
            they put the oysters they find. Oyster are shucked to
            look for pearls, the captain of LT's ship buys most of
            the pearls that are found. They then stop at Dubai. LT
            says that Dubai was once a pirate fortress. The pirate
            built Persian buildings that had "wind towers" . These
            wind towers were open of all four sides, and caught the
            breeze, channeling it down to the living spaces below.
            They serve as a form of are conditioning. Dubai is also
            the place the many Dhows are built using teak wood from
            India. In a square in Dubai, street performers reenact
            a sword fight. As they are about to leave Dubai,
            another merchant comes on board. He brings with him
            food, and carpet and flower for decoration. His
            mysterious cargo is put under the deck, LT says it is
            probably hashish. An ex-slave makes food for the crew
            and LT in a wood burning stove on deck, using fish that
            was caught from the Dhow. ; Format: 35mm; Picture:

            <p>Lowell Thomas describes the sea-faring trip he will
            be making with Arabic traders, in their dhow, to sell
            pearls in Zanzibar, emphasizing that this will be the
            first photographic record of such a trip. After naming
            the crew and describing their devotion to Allah, he
            describes the pearl divers that they will be meeting
            and buying from. The diving, also recorded, takes
            divers 70ft deep where they stay for around 2 min. The
            pearls are sold to the captain and the crew will take
            them to sell in Zanzibar for much more. ; Format: 35mm;

            <p>Lowell Thomas talking about Danger Island. He said
            it's 2,300 miles south of Hawaii. 6,000 miles west of
            South America and 4,000 miles in between water and the
            Antarctic continents. He said they went to Danger
            Island because scientist had decided that there will be
            a total Eclipse and they wanted to get vital
            information concerning the source of our energy and the
            origin of our life and the sun. He said that the
            scientist believes that the sun and the moon would cast
            their shadows on Danger Island which will create the
            Eclipse. He also said Danger Island is a lost pin point
            in the vast of the Pacific Ocean. So he invited people
            to sail the South Sea on an expedition that includes
            the U.S Navy, Polynesian girls, a group of scientist,
            the moon etc... on Monday night January 19.; Format:

            <p>Lowell Thomas shortly interviews an Eastern Airline
            Employee who is currently teaching Tibetan children
            English but doesn't know Tibetan herself. Much of the
            footage is her teaching in action with the children
            repeating simple phrases after her. Lowell Thomas then
            speaks about heading into the jungle with his guide and
            looking for exotic animals, describing a few that may
            be dangerous.; Format: 16mm; Picture: N/A - Audio track

            <p>Audio only. Lowell Thomas is speaking to us from the
            Dalai Lama's Palace. He describes the palace for us in
            detail. Then he changes subject and discusses how he
            fell in love with production and adventure films. He
            wants to convert Cinerama movies to Television. He
            passes the focus on to his friend named Pat. Pat speaks
            of Lowell Thomas' achievements and talents. He
            discusses plans for new Television program plots. One
            about new countries that have been established since
            the end of World War II. Lowell Thomas comes back and
            goes on to list more movie ideas. Pat cuts him off,
            claiming they will run out of film. They wrap up,
            taking about how important and impactful real-world
            stories could be as entertainment.; Format: 16mm;

            <p>Lowell Thomas discusses his travel to Tibet with his
            son, Lowell, jr. They have been invited by the Dalai
            Lama, but are not able to bring anyone else along with
            them. He describes the Tibetan people as peaceful
            isolationists and describes their journey through a
            small, simple town in the valley, where they meet a
            military escort. As they get closer to the city of
            Lhasa, Thomas describes the treacherous baths. He
            describes the city of Lhasa, calling it the â€˜El
            Doradoâ€™ of travelers. They visit a monastery with
            10,000 monks and he describes their lifestyle. The then
            meet the Dalai Lamaâ€™s family, and finally the man
            himself. When they leave, Lowell Thomas is injured by
            an unruly horse. Lowell, jr. takes over and he
            describes the rest of the descent from the city. He
            describes the way that his father is strapped to a
            litter and carried for the rest of the journey. He
            details his fathers condition and how perilous it made
            the journey. Lowell Thomas takes over the end of the
            recording and credits his son for getting him out of
            danger.; Format: 35mm; Picture: N/A - Audio track only;

            clips of men in wet suits jumping into the ice water.
            The trip continues-- LT along with the retired polar
            explorers fly over the north pole. One of the men is
            the only serving member of the historic Perry
            expedition. LT gives a champagne toast to this man as
            they fly over the north pole, because he has finally
            reached it after 48 years. LT also drops flowers as
            they fly over the pole, to honor all those that had
            lost their lives trying to reach it. Tibet-- the Tibet
            trip starts in India. LT and LT jr., along with Tibetan
            porters. load up pack animals in preparation of
            crossing the Himalayas to reach Tibet. They trek down
            cliff and over rivers. Everyone gets lice. Footage
            shows LT trying to wash away the lice in a waterfall.
            When they reach the first Tibetan village that mayor,
            who is 10 feet tall, comes out to greet them giving
            them silk scarfs. In the village they see women weaving
            and making butter. They see a herd of yaks on on a
            large plain. They make it to Lhasa. Officials comes to
            greet LT, and they they will be the hosts.s There is a
            festival in the city. There are giant horns and symbols
            crashing. There is a dance performance where the
            dancers are masked. They go to the largest monastery.
            there they see monks giving out barley flour to the
            poor. LT is finally allowed to meet the Dalai Lama. He
            is on a throne and asks them many questions. They then
            leave Lhasa via river. On the trek back to India, LT
            breaks his hip in eight places. He is then carried on a
            stretcher, and spends many days in pain.; Format: 35mm;

            Remarkable films of Man's 5th Atomic Bomb exploding in
            underwater test. Described by Lowell Thomas. Film
            equipment is positioned for the event, complete with
            lead doors designed to close after film is taken. Shots
            of submarines and warships stationed before the blast.
            Admiral Parsons[sp?] boards the U.S.S. Mount McKinley
            ship to report to Admiral Brandy. Water is tested for
            radioactivity. Blast occurs and "thousands of tons of
            water" mushroom above the surface, causing massive
            destruction. Copyright MCMXLVI, Distributed by

            <p>The film starts with war scenes including bombs,
            soldiers running through fields and throwing grenades,
            and tanks being blown up. The scenes change to a priest
            and nun who are playing and singing with children. A
            band plays while a Catholic procession goes on and the
            following recordings are of the priest being with the
            older boys and the nun with the girls and children. The
            boys learn sewing and carpentry skills and the girls
            sew and sing. A few nuns care for children with
            disabilities and one speaks to the camera, for a
            lengthy time, outside of a playground. The main priest
            and nun drive into Rome and take 3 young girls
            sightseeing in places like the Parthenon and the Trevi
            Fountain. In the next scene the priest and nun take the
            girls to meet the Pope, who speaks with the youngest
            girl the most. Scenes of kids playing outside with the
            priest and nun are played before the film ends and the
            credits roll. ; Format: 16mm; Picture: Color; Audio: ;

            <p>Lowell Thomas saying he is in Vermont and he started
            to talk about the first world war and Allenby . Lowell
            Thomas then started to talk about Bertha Vester and how
            she's one of the greatest women of all times. He said
            that she's almost in her 90th years and she had lived
            in the city of Jerusalem. He also said she was one
            those who took part in the surrender of Jerusalem when
            Allenby's army had drove out the Turks and how he was
            lucky enough to be there at the time. Lowell Thomas
            started to talk about Mrs. Vester looking after the
            wounded in a hospital in Jerusalem which was under the
            control of the Turks. He said how she had ripped a
            white bed sheet in half and she used half as an white
            flag and that he also had apart of that flag himself
            and he said the other half of the flag is in the war
            museum in London. A narrator started to introduced
            Bertha Vester and telling all that she had done. Bertha
            Vester then comes on saying that she had lived in
            Jerusalem for 84 years and that she was under the Turks
            for 40 years, 32 years under the British and 17 years
            under the Arabs but each of them was different. She
            also said that she had lived in 3 wars. She started
            talking about her parents and at this time she wasn't
            born at the time. She was giving a synopsis of why her
            parents had moved to Jerusalem. Her story started off
            with saying how her parents had lived in Chicago but
            then everything was on fire. Her mother had became ill
            after due to the lost of her home and doctors recommend
            her going somewhere else. They had traveled to Europe
            for quite sometime and she had said how her mom was the
            only survivor of ship that had went down, which her mom
            6 children had died in. Her dad had went get her and
            brought her back to America. After lost they had her
            dad had decided to to move to Jerusalem. Bertha Vester
            said her dad motivation to move there was because of
            Jesus. Her explanation was that he had lived, suffer
            and conquered there and her dad had lived suffer and
            now he wanted to conquer also. In 1881 Bertha was 3
            years old, as she goes on telling her story she said
            she had never been to school a day in her life. She was
            thought to paint by an English governor when she was
            about 5 years old. The narrator had started to explain
            the things that was going on at the timer and during
            war time she fed 1700 people a day in a small soup
            kitchen that was started by her mother. Mrs. Vester
            also had took 1600 men that was badly wounded and sick
            in her care. The greatest moment of her life was when
            she had brought the mayor of Jerusalem to meet the
            General to surrender. As the audio went to another
            story she had compared the no room in an inn story to a
            no room in the hospital story on Christmas Eve. Because
            she had took in the baby and many other babies she had
            started a children hospital which became one of her
            greatest achievements.; Format: 16mm; Picture: Black

            <p>Bertha Vester narrates a "Christmas story" with the
            help of Lowell Thomas. Bertha is an American who was
            raised in Jerusalem. Lowell Thomas interjects and talks
            about how in 1917, Edmond Allenby became Commander and
            Chief. (While Bertha was growing up in Jerusalem.)
            Bertha became a nurse and continued to nurse men from
            the Holy Land despite the fact that America had broken
            off relations to Turkey and was not on good terms with
            the city of Jerusalem. Lowell Thomas explains why the
            Mayor of Jerusalem ended up surrendering his city to
            Allenby. Bertha took the Mayor (who she was nursing) to
            surrender. She went to Bethlehem on Christmas Eve and
            brought a sick mother and newborn to the hospital. The
            next day she found out the mother had died but the
            child survived. She took the child in and named him
            Noel. She remained friends with Edmond Allenby as well
            as T.E. Lawrence. Lowell Thomas ends the story by
            nominating Bertha Vester "the greatest American woman
            of our era."; Format: 16mm; Picture: N/A - Audio track

            <p>The film started off with a cottage cheese
            commercial that can be used at breakfast, lunch and at
            supper time with dessert. For breakfast, the commercial
            showed a person hand spreading the cottage cheese on
            omelette. For lunch, the commercial showed a person
            hand spreading the cottage cheese on bread and placing
            peaches on top. For supper time dessert, the commercial
            showed a person hand spreading the cottage cheese on
            pie. The film then showed a Hood Ice cream commercial
            with an inspector that goes by the name check point
            Charlie looking at strawberries, approving ice cream,
            and in the ice cream factor, and it also showed him
            sitting at his desk eating an ice cream sundae. The
            film then cuts back to the cottage cheese commercial
            and then cuts back the hood ice cream commercial. There
            was an back an forth between both commercial multiple
            times then the film went to another commercial of a
            little boy throwing food into a bear mouth. This
            commercial was about Devil Ham Sandwich and that little
            boys and elder men can eat it also. In the background
            was the bear doing like a wave single trying to get the
            attention of the little boy and the man. The film then
            goes to B&amp;M Brick Oven baked beans commercial. The
            commercial started off with hand passing the jar of
            baked beans from one hand to the next. The commercial
            also show a family of four which includes a wife,
            husband, daughter and son sitting at the table having
            dinner with baked beans as option. Each of them were
            engaged into an conversation and then film goes to
            classical music playing. The film then goes back to
            bake bean commercial and then it showed the devil ham
            commercial. Between the devil ham commercial and the
            bake bean commercial it was showed about twelve times
            each with classical music splitting between. The films
            also goes back to the cottage cheese commercial and the
            hood ice cream commercial which played at least seven
            times in the last end of the film. Ballantine Films,

            <p>Lowell Thomas tells "The Story of Bertha Vester."
            Bertha was a woman from Jerusalem who got into nursing
            during the war. Her life became hectic, taking care of
            wounded soldiers. She tells the story of how a woman in
            Bethlehem went into labor. She had to help her get to a
            hospital. She gave birth to the baby on Christmas Eve.
            The parents ended up not being able to take care of
            their child, so they gave him to Bertha. That is how
            she began her orphanage in Jerusalem.; Format: 16mm;

            <p>LT telling the story of the fall of Jerusalem during
            WWI. He starts by saying that this story is like the
            Christmas story in the bible. He centers the story
            around a woman, Bertha Vesters, he met during the fall
            of Jerusalem in 1917. He calls Bertha " a modern day
            Florence Nightingale". Her family moved to "the holy
            land" from Chicago. Bertha grew up in the City, and
            worked as nurse. Field Marshall Allenby drives the
            Turks out of Jerusalem. The Mayor of the Holy City is
            asked to surrender. This mayor goes to Bertha at the
            hospital and asks her the protocol for surrender.
            Bertha cuts a white bed sheet, and marches with the
            Mayor of Jerusalem out of the City wall to help him
            surrender. ; Format: 35mm; Picture: N/A - Audio track

            Lowell Thomas plays with a Huskey in the snow. He lets

            and bring it back. Cut to a blonde little girl
            (toddler) playing with a Dalmatian. The baby hugs the
            dog repeatedly. A red truck stops by a cemetery. Men
            get out and begin breaking up rocks to make soft ground
            for a road. Men ride horses on a path through trees.
            Cut to men skiing down a slope. Men and women stand on
            a balcony as the sun sets. We see the blonde toddler
            again playing with flowers from her garden. She walks
            around as Fran Thomas watches her. More people join the
            group on the balcony. The little girl finds two other
            little girls to play with. The three of them walk
            around the garden picking tulips.; Format: 16mm;
