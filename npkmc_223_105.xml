		<head>Historical Note</head>
		<p>In 1894 representatives from Columbia University, Cornell University, and the University of Pennsylvania selected the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie as the site for regattas of their newly formed Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA). The first Poughkeepsie Regatta was held in June of 1895 and attracted more than 30,000 spectators.  The challenging four-mile course ran south from Crum Elbow (near Hyde Park) to just south of the current site of the Mid-Hudson Bridge.</p>
		<p>Poughkeepsie soon became known as the “Rowing Capital of the World,” hosting IRA regattas from 1895-1949. In addition to the founding members, participants over the years included California, Georgetown, Harvard, MIT, Navy, Princeton, Rutgers, Stanford, Syracuse, Washington, Wisconsin and Yale.  In 1949, the IRA moved its annual regatta briefly to Ohio, and then to Onondaga Lake near Syracuse.</p>
