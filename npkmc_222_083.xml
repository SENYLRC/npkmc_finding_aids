			<head>Collection Overview</head>
			<p>The Scenic Hudson Collection consists of materials documenting the landmark
				environmental law case that opposed the Consolidated Edison Company’s proposed pump
				storage facility at Storm King Mountain, near Cornwall, NY. The Scenic Hudson

				movement. The collection consists of transcripts of hearings from March 9, 1977 to December 12,
				1980. These hearing are titled, EPA National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.
				This case was brought before Judge Thomas B. Yost. Present for the hearings were
				Henry Gluckstern, Attorney for EPA, Region II, Jonathan Strong, Attorney for EPA,
				E.J. Sack Attorney for Con Edison as well as many others. The hearings concluded on
				December 12, 1980 where Con Edison agreed to drop the plan for the Storm King
				facility.</p>

			<head>Historical Note</head>
			<p>In September 1962, the Consolidated Edison Company announced plans to build a pumped
				storage facility, the largest of its kind in the world, at Storm King Mountain near
				Cornwall, New York. The initial application for license to construct the plant was
				filed with the Federal Power Commission in January 1963. On November 8, 1963, a
				small group of concerned citizens met at the home of Carl Carmer and formed the
				Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference to fight the pumped storage project on the
				grounds that it posed a threat to the Cornwall water supply and Hudson River
				fisheries as well as to scenic and historic Storm King Mountain.</p>
			<p>Carl Carmer, author of The Hudson River and other historic works, became honorary
				chairman and Leo O. Rothchild was named chairman. Rothchild served until 1968 and
				was succeeded by Alexander Saunders. Initially, the members, working in their own
				homes or borrowed office space, contacted friends, prominent citizens, politicians,
				and other organizations for financial support, letter writing campaigns, and legal
				intervention. The organizations grew rapidly. Contributions were channeled through
				the Natural Area Council until Scenic Hudson was incorporated in 1974. Rod Vandivert
				became the executive director in the mid-1960s. An office was set up in New York
				City, but the location changed several times during Storm King case and there were a
				number of office managers during that period. Professional fundraisers and public
				relations firms were employed in later years.</p>
			<p>Aided by other organizations and individuals, the group conducted an intensive
				campaign to educate the public and to deter Consolidated Edison by legal means. The
				records, which document the organization’s activities, include publicity materials,
				copies of legal documents submitted by Scenic Hudson and others, and transcripts of
				hearings before Congressional sub-committees and the Federal Power Commission. The
				case lasted for 17 years. In a negotiated settlement in December 1980, Consolidated
				Edison agreed to drop the plan for the Storm King facility. </p>
			<p>The lengthy and controversial case set important precedents in environmental law and
				is generally credited with spawning the modern environmental movement. Scenic
				Hudson, Inc. continues to serve as an environmental watchdog in the Hudson
				Valley.</p>
