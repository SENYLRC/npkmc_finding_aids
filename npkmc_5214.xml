    <bioghist>
      <p>U.S. Hoffman was the successor company to what started out
      as the Hoffman Pressing Machine Company in Syracuse, NY in
      1904. By the 1930s, the U.S. Hoffman Machinery Corp was one
      of the largest producers of a full line of laundry and dry
      cleaning machinery in the United States.</p>
      <p>In 1936, U.S. Hoffman opened a new plant in Poughkeepsie,
      NY, while maintaining their main plant in Syracuse. The
      Poughkeepsie plant was located at 18 Violet Avenue. Before
      the outbreak of WWII, the Poughkeepsie Plant produced a
      variety of equipment for the commercial/industrial
      laundry/dry cleaning industries.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the start of WWII, the Poughkeepsie Plant
      produced a number of mobile, truck mounted laundries that
      could be placed in rear areas of combat zones for use by the
      Quartermaster Corps. However, this plan was quickly dropped,
      as the Plant was converted to produce desperately needed
      munitions. Starting about June 1942, the Poughkeepsie plant
      began manufacturing the projectiles for 40mm anti-aircraft
      shells and continued this work until August 1945. During this
      time period, almost 15 million projectiles were made, and the
      Plant received the Army-Navy E Award, with two subsequent
      stars, for excellence in production. This Award was given to
      only about 3% of all war production plants in WWII, and fewer
      yet to receive subsequent stars. Approximately 600 people
      worked at the Poughkeepsie Plant during the war years, and
      the Plant Manager during the entire period 1936-1947 was
      Peter H. Prenting, a Poughkeepsie resident.</p>
      <p>After the War, the Plant returned to its usual peace time
      production of laundry/dry cleaning machinery and continued in
      operation until August 1947, when the Hoffman Corporation
      decided to consolidate all its NY laundry/dry cleaning
      machinery production at its main plant in Syracuse, N.Y.</p>
      <p>A portion of this collection documents another
      Poughkeepsie business known as Valetor Deluxe Cleaners and
      Dyers. The founding of Valetor Deluxe was a direct result of
      the decision by U.S. Hoffman Machinery Corporation to close
      their Poughkeepsie Plant. The former Plant Manager, Prenting,
      an engineer by profession, decided that he did not wish to
      relocate his family to Syracuse. Instead, he and his family,
      opened their new dry cleaning business.</p>
      <p>The Valetor Deluxe Cleaners and Dryers opened in April
      1948, and the business started with a store and two-story
      plant on Hooker Avenue. This Plant was expanded several times
      in subsequent years to accommodate the growing full-service
      dry cleaners. Valetor ultimately provided dry cleaning, shirt
      laundering, carpet cleaning, tailoring, invisible reweaving,
      in-house leather glove and apparel cleaning and dying,
      wedding gown cleaning and preservation, fur cleaning and
      storage, upholstery cleaning, drapery cleaning, lampshade
      cleaning, and an interior car cleaning service.</p>
      <p>Valetor quickly became the second largest dry cleaning
      establishment in Dutchess County and typically employed about
      20 full time people. The Prenting Family were all involved in
      the business from the outset. Mary Prenting, wife, was
      involved through much of the life of the Company. Daughter,
      Marta, worked part or full time for a couple years, and, son,
      Theodore (Ted) worked part time while in high school,
      subsequently studied at the National Institute of Dry
      Cleaning in Silver Spring, MD, and managed plant operations
      or sales for the business for a total of about five
      years.</p>
      <p>When Peter Prenting passed away in May, 1963, his son,
      Theodore, temporarily returned from his research position at
      IIT Research Institute, Chicago, and managed the business
      until it could be sold in May, 1964. The new owners were
      Isidor Haitkin and Abraham Marinoff, both from Long Island,
      who relocated to Poughkeepsie. They owned the business until
      May 1974, when the Hooker Avenue Plant and Store were damaged
      in a devastating fire. The business never reopened.</p>
