		<head>Historical Note</head>
		<p>Matthew Vassar, Jr., who was born in 1809, was the nephew of Matthew Vassar, who founded Vassar College. Matthew Vassar helped to care for Matthew Vassar, Jr. and his brother John Guy Vassar after their father’s death. Matthew Vassar, Jr. and his brother John were involved in their uncle’s brewing business, becoming partners in the business with their uncle. Both also served as trustees of Vassar College. They were all influential members and philanthropists of the Poughkeepsie community. The brothers both gave funds to finance the construction of the Vassar Brothers Hospital, Laboratory, and The Home for Aged Men.  Matthew Vassar, Jr. also donated money to the Baptist Church, of which he was a member, and served as President of Poughkeepsie branch of the center for the prevention of cruelty to animals. He kept a diary detailing the events transpiring in the country and Poughkeepsie between 1841 and 1880, which the Poughkeepsie Eagle reprinted. Matthew Vassar, Jr. died in August of 1881 at the age of 73. </p>
		<p>Samuel A. Moore, who donated the collection, lived in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. and served as Police Commissioner in the 1930s.</p>
