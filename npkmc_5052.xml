      <p>The Hudson-Fulton Celebration commemorated the 300th
      anniversary of Henry Hudson's discovery of the Hudson River
      and the 100th anniversary of Robert Fulton's first successful
      commercial application of the paddle steamboat. The
      collection was created by Allen Fink and Susan Bette Fink
      (nee Budson). They devoted years to researching and
      collecting Hudson-Fulton Celebration items to create a
      comprehensive collection of materials telling the event's
      story. The Fink's collection was recognized for its
      excellence while featured in a 2009 exhibition celebrating
      the 100th anniversary of the 1909 Hudson-Fulton Celebration
      at the New York State Museum in Albany. Allen Fink
      (1934-2020), a native of Brooklyn, NY, and Passaic, NJ, was
      born in 1934. Allen attended public school until he left
      school and home at 16. He worked various odd jobs - laborer,
      butcher's apprentice, tool, and dye-maker until he joined the
      United States Air Force at 19. While in the USAF, Allen went
      to school to become a radar technician. Later, he served 18
      months in Morocco, working for Strategic Air Command. He
      explored the various cities nearby and learned about the
      history and local customs. Although Allen had not finished
      high school, he continued his education through reading,
      always going to the local library in his community or near
      his military base, reading anything and everything. Upon
      returning to New Jersey in 1959, he attended classes to
      complete his GED. Under the Veteran's GI Bill, Allen entered
      the Newark Institute of Technology, now the New Jersey
      Institute of Technology. During his college years, he worked
      one summer in Israel, affiliated with Technion, the Israel
      Institute of Technology, on telephone communications systems.
      During this time of national insecurity, he was required to
      become a temporary resident to do work in Israel. Allen's
      travels sparked an interest in history, and he began
      collecting stamps during travel from various locations. This
      led to his lifelong passion for collecting other materials,
      including postcards, coins, maps, prints, toys, comic books,
      and other types of ephemera. His specialties included the
      United States, France, the Hudson-Fulton Celebration, Early
      Flight, Zeppelins, the Civil War, and Judaica. Allen married
      Enid Reisberg of Newburgh, NY, and they had two children,
      Steven and Joli Anna. He then continued his education and
      earned a Master's degree in Industrial Management from Union
      College. After college, he began working in the Eclipse
      Pioneer Division of Bendix Aviation Corporation. In 1964,
      after several years in Advanced Research and Development,
      Allen left Bendix and joined International Business Machines
      (IBM) in Poughkeepsie, NY. At IBM, he worked in the research
      and development of mainframes until his retirement in 1993.
      After Allen retired from IBM, he continued to pursue his
      passion for collecting. In 1997, he married Susan Budson, who
      joined him in his varied endeavors, including table tennis
      and competition, and shared his passion for collecting.
      Post-retirement, Allen joined Vassar College as their Table
      Tennis Coach, was an active member of Vassar Temple, and
      taught classes at IBM and Marist College Center for Lifetime
      Studies. In his life, Allen encouraged people to pursue their
      interests and passions, learn, and be the best they could
      be.</p>
