			<head>Historical Note</head>
			<p>John J. Russell was born on February 29, 1920 to Joseph Russell and Genevieve Toner
				in Manhattan, New York. He was the oldest of three siblings; he had two younger
				sisters, Genevieve and Mary Russell. Because he was color blind John was not able to
				enlist in the United States Army in the early stages of World War II. When the war
				escalated John was drafted and chose to go into the Air Force Weather Squadron. His
				duties included observing the weather to ensure it was clear for army planes, and
				making sure they were able to take off and land safely at their destinations;
				without his signature on the departure form, no plane could leave the hanger. His
				major assignment was in Tindouf, Algeria at the weather station. John advanced in
				the ranks throughout his three year tour to Technical Sergeant.</p>
			<p>At the end of John’s Army career in 1946, he heeded his late calling to join the
				Order of Marist Brothers. John’s first experience with the Brothers was during his
				elementary school days when they acted as his teachers. He also had connections to
				this order through his Aunt Tess, who was a Sister in a related order. After serving
				as a Novitiate for two years John received the Marist Habit and also during this
				time, graduated from Marian College (now Marist College) with a degree in history in
				1950. In 1953 John made his final vows to join the Marist Brotherhood for life, and
				was renamed Brother J. Cornelius Russell.</p>
			<p>Brother Cornelius was a humble person who lived by the Marist Principle to “do good
				quietly.” Before he returned to Marist College, Brother Cornelius taught at other
				Marist Brother Schools, including schools in the Bronx and Briarwood in New York,
				Lawrence, Massachusetts, and Augusta, Georgia. During this time, he received an MBA,
				from Columbia University. In 1962 Brother Cornelius was brought to Marist College to
				incorporate a business major to help widen the school’s curriculum and to draw in
				more prospective students. He was the first full-time business faculty member and
				first business department chairman at Marist College. In 1964 President Foy
				appointed him Controller, a position he held for several years. As the Controller
				Brother Cornelius had the responsibility of overseeing Marist College’s financial
				planning. On May 20th, 1995 Brother Cornelius was given the President’s Award by
				President Murray for his diligence while at Marist College and after his retirement.
				During his retirement he was also able to devote more of himself to the Marist
				Brotherhood and on March 3, 1996 he was given Pope John Paul II Apostolic Blessing.
				Brother Cornelius’s long and excellent teaching record was recognized on October
				10th, 2003 when he was named one of Marist’s Heritage Professors. </p>
			<p>Brother Cornelius was a vibrant, but humble person who left his mark on not only
				Marist College, but on the lives and hearts of many other people he met throughout
				his travels.</p>
